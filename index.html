						<ul>
							<li>another MVC framework,</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							If anything, it merely gives you the 'V', or view part, of MVC. Its up to you to find something that will handle the 'M' & 'C'.

						<h2>What makes up react.js?</h2>
					</section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description-->
					<section>
						<p>React.js is made up out of components - and components are quite literally things you'd like to render. React then updates and render or re-render components when data changes.</p>
					</section>

                    <!--What makes up react.js: Components-->
                    <section>
                        <p>You can split up your component types (I usually do) into some of the following:</p>
                        <p class="fragment">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>components</b>: These are bare bones components, usually pure and stateless without any business logic. Do not focus
                                on the look of the component - this is about function and use.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            But that's just me - you can add everything under components or remove views and add everything with more than one component
                            under a container. That's up to you. Just remember to pick a standard and keep with it.
                        </aside>
                    </section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description + Containers-->
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">
						<ul>
							<li>
                                <b>containers</b>: These are collections of 1 or more components used to make something else.
                                This could be forms, collections of inputs and buttons - something that isn't a complete page,
                                but functionality wise can be separate from the page yet is made up from various components.
                            </li>
						</ul>
						</p>
					</section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description + Views-->
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">
						<ul>
							<li>
                                <b>views</b>: Think of this as a literal page - a complete rendered view. This consists of
                                containers and components alike, just like containers and components there should not be any
                                business logic (only render logic) in a view.
                            </li>

						<p>Disclaimer; this might be a long section...</p>
                    </section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: JSX-->
					<section>
						<h4>Make friends with JSX</h4>
						<p>
							You're going to be using some JSX syntax - but don't look at JSX from the JSX website, rather
							have a look over at Facebook. It isn't really important functionally - but it does add some syntactic sugar.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's that link: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html
						</aside>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: Components-->
					<section>
						<h4>Make small, functional focused components</h4>
						<p>
							Do not over-engineer and try to make a component out of everything, but if something does have its own
							behaviour and it makes sense to abstract it - make the component small and compact. This makes it easy to
							maintain, test and even extend on.
						</p>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: React.Component-->
					<section>
						<h4>Using React.Component</h4>
						<p>
							This syntax for declaring a Component is most commonly used when you're making use of the various
							react.js life-cycles.
						</p>
						<p>
							<pre>
								<code data-trim>
								class YourComponent extends React.Component {
									render() return { some div element here };
								}
								</code>
							</pre>
						</p>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: const MyComponent = props =>-->
					<section>
						<h4>Using const YourComponent = props =></h4>
						<p>
							If you're not making use of any life-cycles, you can declare it as a function for a simpler syntax.
							This usually also indicates that your component will be stateless (no state - no need for life-cycles).
						</p>
						<p>
							<pre>
								<code data-trim>
								const YourComponent = props => {
									return({ some div element here });
								};
								</code>
							</pre>
						</p>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: Pure Component-->
					<section>
						<h4>Components VS Pure Components</h4>
						<p>
							Pure Components are similar to regular Components - with the exception that it implements the
							shouldComponentUpdate() lifecycle method with a shallow prop and state comparison. Thus if you're
							creating a Component which does not make use of state - it is more efficient to declare it as a Pure Component.
							You do have the option to declare it as a function, per the previous slide, but according to the React.js
							documentation, it is more efficient to declare it as a Pure Component.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's a link for more info on Pure Components: https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-api.html#react.purecomponent
						</aside>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: ES6-->
					<section>
						<h4>Use ES6</h4>
						<p>
							It should be obvious from the previous examples - but it might be a good idea to switch over to
							use ES6 syntax. It gives you the ability to make use of the class declaration syntax for Components,
							it gives you command over Property Initialisers and even Arrow Functions - just to mention a few.
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Here's a link for more info on ES6: https://babeljs.io/blog/2015/06/07/react-on-es6-plus
						</aside>
					</section>

					<!--Things I wish I knew before starting with react.js: Extra Technologies-->
					<section>
						<h4>What other stuff do I need?</h4>
						<p>
							React.js, JSX, ES6 and Redux.js isn't the only two libraries and technologies you'll need to
							make all of this work... You'll also have to consider:
							<ul>
								<li>
									<b>Babel</b>: This literally transpiles everything and removes any build time complexities.
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>Webpack</b>: How the hell else will you bundle your code for deploys and testing?
								</li>
								<li>
									<b>NPM</b>: Well since you now have dependencies, why not add a dependency to manage your dependency? (INCEPTION!!!)
								</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Babel: https://babeljs.io
							Webpack: https://webpack.js.org
							NPM: https://www.npmjs.com

				<!--Conclusion-->
				<section>
					<h2>If you're going react.js...</h2>
					<p>
						... consider that you'll need to understand JavaScript VERY well, understand the JS ecosystem and
						really have at least an intermediate grasp of Object Oriented and Functional Programming to use
						it with ease. But if you do not - don't fear! There's ton of start kits and sources out there!
					</p>
