							<li>another MVC framework,</li>
							<li>an all in one solution,</li>

							If anything, it merely gives you the 'V', or view part, of MVC. Its up to you to find something that will handle the 'M' & 'C'.

						<h2>What makes up react.js?</h2>
					</section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description-->
					<section>
						<p>React.js is made up out of components - and components are quite literally things you'd like to render. React then updates and render or re-render components when data changes.</p>
					</section>

                    <!--What makes up react.js: Components-->
                    <section>
                        <p>You can split up your component types (I usually do) into some of the following:</p>
                        <p class="fragment">
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>components</b>: These are bare bones components, usually pure and stateless without any business logic. Do not focus
                                on the look of the component - this is about function and use.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>
                        <aside class="notes">
                            But that's just me - you can add everything under components or remove views and add everything with more than one component
                            under a container. That's up to you. Just remember to pick a standard and keep with it.
                        </aside>
                    </section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description + Containers-->
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">
						<ul>
							<li>
                                <b>containers</b>: These are collections of 1 or more components used to make something else.
                                This could be forms, collections of inputs and buttons - something that isn't a complete page,
                                but functionality wise can be separate from the page yet is made up from various components.
                            </li>
						</ul>
						</p>
					</section>

					<!--What makes up react.js: Description + Views-->
					<section>
						<p class="fragment">
						<ul>
							<li>
                                <b>views</b>: Think of this as a literal page - a complete rendered view. This consists of
                                containers and components alike, just like containers and components there should not be any
                                business logic (only render logic) in a view.
                            </li>
